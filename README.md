# A Repository of various useful scripts , script-snippets and complete Software written in Javascript, and PHP

## [Process WPDB Geodatabase Files](./wpdb-geodatabase-processor)

The goal is to process and split the **huge geodatabase files in "geojson format"** which can be as big as 10GB each, or even much bigger, by computers with low memory (<= 8GB), without crashing the script running out of memory. It splits hem into smaller json chunks which then can be handled better for easy injection as layers into maps by web applications.

## [Simple CORS Proxy](./cors-proxy)

This script sets up a **CORS Anywhere proxy server** that acts as an intermediary to bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions in web browsers. CORS is a security mechanism that prevents web pages from making requests to domains different from their own, which can be problematic during development or when accessing APIs from client-side JavaScript.
